# Washstation-Datalogging
collecting data about the availability of washers of the washstation app with the ability to reserve them for personal use

requires account details
also requires the device id, client secret and client id. The way in which I found these was using a proxy and capturing traffic coming from my phone through my computer using a proxying service called charles ( ssl proxying must be turned on ). Once this information is supplied to the api requests can be made succesfully.


TODO:
 - every consecutive day create another file, in a specified directory to save to, that will have the day in the name.
